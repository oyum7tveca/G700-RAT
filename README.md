The G700 RAT is an evolved form of Craxs RAT, designed with advanced functionalities to exploit Android devices, especially within the cryptocurrency and financial environments. Developed in C# and Java, this malware targets mobile app security gaps to achieve unauthorized access and execute harmful actions while remaining undetected. It uses privilege escalation, screen capture, and phishing, to intercept sensitive information, bypass security authentications, and deploy ransomware. Currently distributed through underground networks, it poses a growing threat to device security, demanding awareness and comprehensive protection strategies.
